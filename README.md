# Iris-flower-classification
<br>In this project, we utilize the Iris dataset's independent features, which include the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. These measurements are given in centimeters. The dependent feature, or the output for our model, is the Species, which identifies the specific flower species corresponding to the given measurements.
